  <h1>Privacy Policy – Catalyst</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 17, 2026</p>

  <p>
    Catalyst: Prosthetic Guide (“Catalyst,” “the app”) is an educational application intended to provide
    general information related to lower-limb prosthetics, common troubleshooting topics, and peer support resources.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Catalyst does not collect, store, transmit, sell, or share personal data.</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>No user accounts or logins</li>
    <li>No analytics or advertising services</li>
    <li>No tracking for advertising purposes</li>
    <li>No precise GPS location collection by Catalyst</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>
    Some app preferences and selections (for example, favorites or onboarding selections) may be stored locally
    on your device to improve your experience. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to the developer.
  </p>

  <h2>ZIP Code Search and Maps</h2>
  <p>
    If you use the peer support group search feature, you may enter a ZIP code to filter results.
    The ZIP code is used within the app to display nearby listings and is <strong>not</strong> stored, retained,
    or transmitted by Catalyst.
  </p>
  <p>
    The map feature may use Apple Maps to render map tiles and pins. Apple’s services may process information
    as part of providing maps functionality. Please review Apple’s privacy practices for additional details.
  </p>

  <h2>Email Links</h2>
  <p>
    If you choose to contact a listed organization or contact the developer, Catalyst may open your device’s
    default email application. Catalyst does not collect, access, or store the contents of emails you send.
  </p>

  <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>

    Always consult a licensed healthcare professional for medical decisions.
