      <strong>Summary:</strong>

  <h2>1. Educational Use Only</h2>
  <p>
    Catalyst provides educational and informational content only.
    It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment and does not replace
    care from a licensed prosthetist, physician, therapist, or other qualified healthcare professional.
  </p>
  <p>
    Troubleshooting tools and decision guides identify possible associations only.
    They do not diagnose medical conditions, determine causation, or recommend treatment.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Emergency Use</h2>
  <p>
    This app is not intended for emergency use.
    If you are experiencing a medical emergency, severe pain, skin breakdown,
    mechanical failure, instability, or have fallen, seek professional medical care immediately.
  </p>

  <h2>3. User Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    Prosthetic fit, alignment, component settings, and rehabilitation decisions
    are highly individualized. You are solely responsible for decisions made
    based on information provided within the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before making changes
    to your prosthesis, suspension system, activity level, exercise routine, or skin care.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Listings and Resources</h2>

    Catalyst may include publicly available listings of peer support groups,
    organizations, websites, meeting schedules, addresses, and contact information.

    Catalyst does not control, verify, endorse, or guarantee the accuracy,
